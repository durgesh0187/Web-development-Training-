    <p align="center">One moment I was in the air, Above the clouds, nowhere to be found. <br>
        One moment I was below the Earth, In its core I was bound. <br>
        One moment I was in a palace, And the other in a cottage so small. <br>
        One moment I was happy with a stick And the other, I hated my expensive ball. </p>


    <p align="center">Time changes as we go, <br>
        We canâ€™t follow it; it just goes, <br>
        Time is precious <br>
        So this is what we learnt folks! <br>
